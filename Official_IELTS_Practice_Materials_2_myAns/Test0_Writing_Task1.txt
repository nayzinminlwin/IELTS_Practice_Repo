My Answer: 

The presented bar graph compares the difference in reservation and consumption of world's oil resources in 9 different areas of the world.

Overall, it can be witness that Middle East is holding more than half of the world's oil resource propotion while Asia is responsible for consuming almost half of that amount.

To dive into details, Middle East is maintaining half of the whole world's oil propotion, depicting 56.52% in which it only consume 6.15%. There are four other substainable areas like Middle East which use less oil resources than it preserve are Canada, indicating nearly 15% in storage and only 2.5% of usage, Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa, in which the three areas depicting the range of 8% to 6% in storing and 7% to 3% in spending. 

Other areas of the world show need of oil resources as their oil expenditure exceed what they preserved. The most area demanding the resource is Asia because it use 26.21% of world's oil resources while it can only contribute below 3% in storing. Another area worse than Asia is United States as it consume the same amount but storing only 1.85% of it which is almost the same storage as Western Europe. However, Western Europe required only 19.24% for consumption. Moreover, Austrilia and New Zealand contribute very slightly in both storing and consuming and other areas of the world do the same.
