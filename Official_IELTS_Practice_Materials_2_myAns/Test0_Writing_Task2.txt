My Answer :

Nowadays, young people's attitude toward elderly people are swifting and they show too little respect and gratitude.

There are several causes for this issue. Young people of this era are getting more privillages and authorizations in significant amount of activities in every sectors as they are refered as the leaders of the younger generations and they are taken for granted more than what they did or they are capable of doing. Those acts make young people arrogant and over-confident that they think they know everything, they can do anything, and they are most important and superior to others, especially elderly people, but they do not think about who send them to those places, who give and teach them these knowledge and experiences, and most importantly, young people are busy being proud of what they can do, forgetting to appreciate what their ancesstors had done to facilitate them in such achievements.

There will be the time to pay the piper, as every act come with a consquence. Right ? With all these disrespects, we will also be lacking in admiring them and learning their most precious experiences to avoid mistakes from the past and shape a better future. In Myanmar, we have a saying," We shall harvest what we have grown." The history will repeat itself and those who show disrepect will get the exact same as what they have done. And people in the society will be afraid to get older because of those act and also such mindsets that elderly people are useless and they do not deserve anything but ignorance. The most heartbreaking problem is there will be significant increasement in sucidal rate among old people. 

To sum up the facts and effects, we are not too late to correct ourselves and our surrounding. Everyone want to live a happy life with grand parents and grand children that the society including us have the responsibility to secure such environment to us and all elderly people around the world.
