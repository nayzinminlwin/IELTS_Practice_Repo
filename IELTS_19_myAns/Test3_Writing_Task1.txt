Writing - Task 1

Q:
The diagram below shows how a biofuel called ethanol is produced.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisions where relevant.
Write at least 150 words.

============================================================================

My Answer :

The illustrated diagram describes the step-by-step procedure of a biofuel, ethanol, production.

At the overall first glance, it is evident that the process includes 10 steps, starting from absortion of CO2 by plants and trees, ethanol formation in the middle, and then decomposition back to carbon dioxide again.

In detailed process, it starts from the photosenthesic process of the trees and plants in which they breath CO2 and use sunlight for their food. Then those palnts are being harvested and deformed into cellulose in the Pre-processing stage. Then they are processed to form sugars, and Micobes are added afterward to make Ethanol.

After ethanol formation, it is used in the vehicles like cars, trucks, and even planes as fuel. Again, ethanol is decomposed by vehicle engines to form CO2 which is released back to the atmosphere for plants to absort and repeat the process again. This is the way ethanol circle in our surrounding.

GPT Prompt :

### Overall Band Score: 6.0

### 1. **Coherence and Cohesion**: 6
- Structure your answers in logical paragraphs: ✅
- One main idea per paragraph: ✅
- Include an introduction and conclusion: ❌ (Conclusion is somewhat unclear)
- Support main points with an explanation and then an example: ❌
- Use cohesive linking words accurately and appropriately: ❌ (Some transitions are awkward)
- Vary your linking phrases using synonyms: ❌

Your answer is generally clear with logical paragraphs, but there are awkward transitions like "At the overall first glance" and "In detailed process," which make it harder to follow. Additionally, the conclusion could be more specific. The introduction could also be clearer with a better explanation of the diagram's overall process.

**Suggestions**:
- Use smoother transitions: "At first glance" or "In summary."
- Improve the conclusion: "In this way, ethanol is continuously produced and used as a renewable fuel source."

### 2. **Lexical Resource**: 6
- Try to vary your vocabulary using accurate synonyms: ❌
- Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning: ✅ (Some technical terms are used well)
- Check your work for spelling and word formation mistakes: ❌ (Multiple spelling and word choice errors)

Your vocabulary is appropriate for the task, with terms like "photosynthesis," "cellulose," and "microbes," but there are spelling mistakes like "absortion" (should be "absorption"), "breath" (should be "breathe"), "palnts" (should be "plants"), "Micobes" (should be "Microbes"), and "deformed" (should be "broken down" or "processed"). More variation in word choice could elevate your score.

**Suggestions**:
- Use synonyms for common words: Instead of "deformed," use "broken down" or "processed."
- Check spelling and use correct forms of words.

---

### 3. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: 5
- Use a variety of complex and simple sentences: ✅
- Check your writing for errors: ❌ (Frequent grammatical errors)

You use some complex sentences, but there are many grammatical errors that affect clarity, such as "those palnts are being harvested and deformed into cellulose" (should be "those plants are harvested and broken down into cellulose") and "breath CO2" (should be "breathe CO2"). Articles are often omitted, and sentence structures can be awkward.

**Suggestions**:
- Correct articles and sentence structure: "The plants are harvested and broken down into cellulose."
- Ensure subject-verb agreement: "Plants and trees absorb CO2" (not "absort").

---

### 4. **Task Achievement**: 7
- Answer all parts of the question: ✅
- Present relevant ideas: ✅
- Fully explain these ideas: ❌ (Some steps need more clarity)
- Support ideas with relevant, specific examples: ❌ (Limited details on each step)

You adequately describe the process of ethanol production and its cyclic nature, but some steps need more explanation. For example, the pre-processing stage and how sugars are formed could be elaborated on. Additionally, the role of microbes in ethanol production is mentioned but not explained in detail.

**Suggestions**:
- Expand on certain steps: "During pre-processing, cellulose is extracted from plants, which is then converted into sugars."
- Clarify the role of microbes: "Microbes are added to convert sugars into ethanol."

### High-Band Vocabulary:
1. **Photosynthesis** – the process by which plants convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into energy.
2. **Cellulose** – a complex carbohydrate that is the main component of plant cell walls.
3. **Microbes** – microorganisms such as bacteria used in the fermentation process.
4. **Ethanol** – a type of biofuel produced from organic materials.
5. **Decomposition** – the process of breaking down substances.
6. **Absorb** – to take in (e.g., plants absorb carbon dioxide).

---

### Final Comments:
To improve your score, you need to focus on reducing grammatical errors, particularly in word choice, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. Adding more detail to the stages of the process and improving your transitions will also enhance clarity and coherence. Additionally, checking for spelling mistakes will help make your writing more polished.
