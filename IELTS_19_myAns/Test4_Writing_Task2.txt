My Answer :

As we are living in a rapid developing countries, everything we need are at the stretch of our arms. We can see everything around the world through the screen in our hands, and nowadays we can even taste delicious food from the various countries at our supermarkets. Such improvements provide significant advantages to society, but more or less, along with some drawbacks.

Most of the people in most countries have the similar types of meal for many years with very slight variations in it. For instance, burmese people eat significant amount of rice and they feel uncomfortable if rice is not available in their meals as they do not feel nutrious. Moreover, they also rely on rice for other variations of meal like snacks, desserts, side dish, and so forth, and Japanese people do too. Indian people make uncountable variations of meal from flour which is same with Europeans. Without availability of foreign food and products, we would be going everyday the same with these meals throughout our lives. Thus, different kind of food and products from other nations in supermarkets are kind of thing we should welcome and appreciate of. We can explore nations' traditions and culture through thier foods like Sushi representing Japan, Ramyung(Noodles) representing Korea, Tea representing India, biscuits representing Britian, and so on. Moreover, a wide variety of choices in food mean we got larger pool of options for better diet for our health. 

Nonetheless, we should not ignore some negative effects of such availability and abundance. No matter how the technology advanced, cargo still take time to travel from place to place, and most of the cargo, including foods are still traded with ships these days, they took months to deliver dock to dock and even more time to supermarkets and customers. So we must keep in mind that the products are not fresh as they are produced in these countries even though products have expired and best-before dates. The issue may be bold in wet and frozen food and product like meat, fruits, and vegetables. Another matter is the risk of spoiling the traditional tastes for the sake of business advantage or customer preferences like cold Jjajangmen in which it is nonsense for Koreans to eat Pea-Noodle (Jjajangmen) in cold stage. 

To conclude the pros and cons of the availability of products from different countries in our supermarket do not seems such an issue as profits outweight the drawbacks, but we have to make sure things are not out of control.
