My Answer :

The illustrated pie-chart and bar-graph enumerate the percentage on usage of different locations along with count of students and their ages participating in current dance classes in a town of Australia.

At the overall first glance, it is evident that majority of the dance classes are opened in the private studios, and students under age of 11 prefer ballet dance while modern dance classes are mostly occupied by elder students.

To describe the information of location in detail, almost half, 48% of the dance classes are established in private studios. Meanwhile, school halls (after-school) allocate 24% of the classes while College-based studios and Community halls & others occupy 10% and 18% respectively.

The research indicate two age types which is under 11 and age ranging 11 to 16, and three dance groups, Ballet, Tap Dance, and Modern dances. In which, 600 students of former group show interest on Ballet dance, but only half of that count from elder group do the same. In contrast, there are only 300 participants of first group in Modern dance classes while 500 of elder students group are committing to it. Tap dance is shown no signigicant gap in preferance from all students indicating between 400 to 500 classmates.
