### Overall Band Score: 6.5

### 1. **Coherence and Cohesion**: 6
- Structure your answers in logical paragraphs: ✅
- One main idea per paragraph: ✅
- Include an introduction and conclusion: ✅
- Support main points with an explanation and then an example: ❌ (Some points lack detail and specific examples)
- Use cohesive linking words accurately and appropriately: ❌ (Some linking words are inaccurate)
- Vary your linking phrases using synonyms: ❌ (Limited variation in linking words)

Your response has a logical structure with a clear introduction and description of the key changes. However, you need more specific explanations and examples of these changes to enhance cohesion. There are also some inappropriate linking words, such as "and the area for cafes" (a better phrase could be "additionally, a section for cafés"). More varied connectors like "in contrast" or "similarly" would improve cohesion.

**Suggestions**:
- "Moreover, the road was extended to provide access to the newly renovated hotel."
- "In addition, a private beach was created exclusively for hotel guests, unlike the previous public beach."

### 2. **Lexical Resource**: 6
- Try to vary your vocabulary using accurate synonyms: ❌ (Limited variation of words)
- Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning: ✅
- Check your work for spelling and word formation mistakes: ❌ (Several spelling issues)

You use some relevant vocabulary such as "implemented," "renovated," and "refurbished." However, there are noticeable spelling and word choice issues ("descibe" should be "describe," "entended" should be "extended"). Vocabulary variation is also somewhat limited, with repeated words like "new."

**Suggestions**:
- Replace "new" with alternatives such as "additional" or "recent."
- Vary your word choices by using synonyms, e.g., "construct" instead of "build."

---

### 3. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: 6
- Use a variety of complex and simple sentences: ✅
- Check your writing for errors: ❌ (Several grammatical and punctuation errors)

You attempt a variety of sentence structures, but there are several errors in grammar and punctuation. For example, "and area for cafes and shops was built additionally" is missing an article and could be rewritten more smoothly. Some sentences are too long without appropriate punctuation, such as commas.

**Suggestions**:
- Instead of "and the area for cafes and shops was built additionally," try: "Additionally, a section for cafés and shops was constructed."
- Improve punctuation: "To describe in detail, a new dock was implemented next to the old one, and the Marina and fishing boat areas were switched."

---

### 4. **Task Achievement**: 7
- Answer all parts of the question: ✅
- Present relevant ideas: ✅
- Fully explain these ideas: ❌ (Some points lack detailed explanations)

You effectively describe the main changes, like the new dock, hotel, and private beach, but you need more detailed explanations. Additionally, you could improve by offering a more in-depth comparison between the two maps and including more precise details about the changes to the layout.

**Suggestions**:
- Instead of simply stating, "a new dock was implemented," provide more details such as: "A second dock was constructed, expanding the capacity for passenger ferries."
- Add more comparison: "In contrast to 2000, when the beach was public, today's map shows that a portion of the beach has become private for hotel guests."
