My Answer: 

As we are living in a swiftly developing and highly competitive world, money play an fatal role in our lives as everyone are working very hard for that. Along with earning money, we are in need of strategies to save or even multiply it for better future. But there are belives that saving is better for every age, young or old while somes argue.

To achieve the financial freedom, experts say, 'first step is to start saving your money.' So it cannot be wrong to save our money. Saving it give us a secure future without help from other people or even our own bloodline. Most adults save money than youths as they feel they do not have less time to work and they want to take a rest when they cannot work anymore. However, in this competitive era, we can also encounter young people saving their money, some are doing for the sake of achievements,especially goals achieveable in short period of time, like a branded shoe, or a gadget, whereas there hides the youths with better insights, for instance, to pursue thier hobby by their own, to establish a company of something they would like to do in mass measure, and so forth. As the wise men say, 'Being late is better than never.', we should do what we should be doing in the meantime. Right ?

On the other hand, we got people holding a very popular practice, 'YOLO, you only live once.'. They belive those saving will not follow them to the grave. In fact, they are not wrong though. But instead of wasting them on unnecessary luxry products under YOLO title, we should be doing a better approach than saving, investing. Experts quote, "The second step of financial freedom is multiplying your money.", in which they mean multiplying by acquiring passive incomes. Significant amount of people are investing nowadays rather than just saving. Youths are fond of investing as it can give them thrills like gambling, while elderly people are afraid of investing in the wrong hand. But educated investments can lead us to ultimate victory which is immersely abundant than our life savings.

To conlcude the opinions and examples, I belive we should be doing what we are suppose to do, like saving and investing, no matter young or old, rather than living a meaningless life without a purpose.

GPT prompt :

### Overall Band Score: 5.5

### 1. **Coherence and Cohesion**: 5
- Structure your answers in logical paragraphs: ❌ (Paragraphs are not clearly defined)
- One main idea per paragraph: ❌ (Multiple ideas in some paragraphs)
- Include an introduction and conclusion: ✅
- Support main points with an explanation and then an example: ❌ (Some points lack proper development)
- Use cohesive linking words accurately and appropriately: ❌ (Linking words are used awkwardly)
- Vary your linking phrases using synonyms: ❌

Your answer lacks a clear structure. Ideas are scattered, and paragraphs often mix different points. For example, the first paragraph introduces both saving and investing, which could be separated. Some linking phrases are awkward, like "But there are belives that" (should be "some believe that") and "In fact, they are not wrong though" (this phrase feels redundant).

**Suggestions**:
- Structure the essay clearly with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
- Use more appropriate linking words like "However," "On the contrary," or "In contrast" to guide the reader through your ideas.

- Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning: ✅

You use some advanced vocabulary such as "financial freedom," "multiply," and "passive income." However, there are numerous spelling mistakes like "belives" (should be "believes"), "luxry" (should be "luxury"), "thier" (should be "their"), "conlcude" (should be "conclude"). You could also vary your synonyms more frequently instead of repeating similar words like "save" and "saving."
