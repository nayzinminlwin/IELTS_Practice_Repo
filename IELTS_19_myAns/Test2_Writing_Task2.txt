My Answer :

As we are living in a very competitive world, majority of the people spend most of their time in their works. So that, various ideas are emerging day after day to save us from this rat race. Nonetheless, it will be very challenging to break the circile in which everyone's wellbeing is depending on. One of the ideas is people suggesting that the weekdays should be lesser than the weekends for the sake of fewer work.

Extending the weekend heard like a idea of blessing for most of the people. But the only issue is that we are hopeless to break the rule. In Japan, the government itself is restricting working hours instead of expanding the country's GDP. However, after seeing their problem, they are not wrong though. The issue indicate that the Japanese people are extremely overworking that their population toll is decling becaus they are busy working to even get married. So longer weekends, shorter weekdays may help that kind of country recover not only mental health of the people but also some human resources. Furthermore, most of us feels like weekends are very short and we can only feel happiness for one night and Sunday nights are nightmare, thinking of Monday mornings. People will be on the moon if they get just one extra weekend days. And by doing so, it will ultimately boost our productivity and peace of mind, to be more creative and cope with more challenging problems.

On the other hand, there are significant amount of people who are working hard because they are willing to. Overtimes display the most efficient example. Those kinds of people seek income instead of leisure, not because they want to, but because they have to. In that case, their hard work may pay off with their dream life or a higher standard for their families or better supports and opportunities for their children what their own parents couldn't. So employer or employee, weekdays or weekend, simply it do not matter for them.

To conclude the opinions, short working weekdays and long weekends seems fancy and pleasing to hear, but it will be almost impossible to implement such idea.
