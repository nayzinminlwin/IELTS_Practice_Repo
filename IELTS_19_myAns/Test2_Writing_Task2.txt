My Answer :

As we are living in a very competitive world, majority of the people spend most of their time in their works. So that, various ideas are emerging day after day to save us from this rat race. Nonetheless, it will be very challenging to break the circile in which everyone's wellbeing is depending on. One of the ideas is people suggesting that the weekdays should be lesser than the weekends for the sake of fewer work.

Extending the weekend heard like a idea of blessing for most of the people. But the only issue is that we are hopeless to break the rule. In Japan, the government itself is restricting working hours instead of expanding the country's GDP. However, after seeing their problem, they are not wrong though. The issue indicate that the Japanese people are extremely overworking that their population toll is decling becaus they are busy working to even get married. So longer weekends, shorter weekdays may help that kind of country recover not only mental health of the people but also some human resources. Furthermore, most of us feels like weekends are very short and we can only feel happiness for one night and Sunday nights are nightmare, thinking of Monday mornings. People will be on the moon if they get just one extra weekend days. And by doing so, it will ultimately boost our productivity and peace of mind, to be more creative and cope with more challenging problems.

On the other hand, there are significant amount of people who are working hard because they are willing to. Overtimes display the most efficient example. Those kinds of people seek income instead of leisure, not because they want to, but because they have to. In that case, their hard work may pay off with their dream life or a higher standard for their families or better supports and opportunities for their children what their own parents couldn't. So employer or employee, weekdays or weekend, simply it do not matter for them.

To conclude the opinions, short working weekdays and long weekends seems fancy and pleasing to hear, but it will be almost impossible to implement such idea.

GPT Assessment :

### Overall Band Score: 6.0

---

### 1. **Coherence and Cohesion**: 6
- Structure your answers in logical paragraphs: ✅
- One main idea per paragraph: ✅
- Include an introduction and conclusion: ✅
- Support main points with an explanation and then an example: ❌ (Some points are underdeveloped)
- Use cohesive linking words accurately and appropriately: ❌ (Some issues with linking words)
- Vary your linking phrases using synonyms: ❌ (Limited variation in linking words)

Your essay is organized logically with clear paragraphs and a well-structured introduction and conclusion. However, some points need more detailed explanations and examples. Additionally, there are some issues with transitions and linking words, such as "heard like a idea" (should be "sounds like a good idea") and "So employer or employee, weekdays or weekend, simply it do not matter" (which is awkwardly phrased). A better use of cohesive devices and smoother transitions would improve the flow.

**Suggestions**:
- Instead of "Extending the weekend heard like a idea," try: "Extending the weekend sounds appealing to most people."
- Use more varied transitions: "Moreover," "In contrast," "As a result."

---

### 2. **Lexical Resource**: 6
- Try to vary your vocabulary using accurate synonyms: ❌ (Repetition of certain words, e.g., "weekend," "people")
- Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning: ✅
- Check your work for spelling and word formation mistakes: ❌ (Several errors)

There are some good uses of vocabulary like "rat race," "mental health," and "boost productivity," but many common words such as "weekend" and "people" are overused. There are also several spelling and word formation mistakes, such as "circile" instead of "circle" and "decling" instead of "declining."

**Suggestions**:
- Use synonyms like "individuals" for "people" or "workweek" for "weekdays."
- Replace "weekend days" with "additional days off."
- Focus on checking spelling and using accurate word forms.

---

### 3. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: 5
- Use a variety of complex and simple sentences: ✅
- Check your writing for errors: ❌ (Frequent grammatical errors)

Your essay includes some complex sentences, but there are frequent grammatical mistakes that reduce clarity. Issues such as subject-verb agreement ("majority of the people spend" should be "the majority of people spends") and article usage ("heard like a idea" should be "sounds like an idea") are present. There are also awkward sentence structures, such as "the issue indicate that the Japanese people are extremely overworking" (should be "the issue indicates that the Japanese are overworked").

**Suggestions**:
- Correct article usage: "Extending the weekend sounds like a great idea."
- Pay attention to subject-verb agreement: "The majority of people spends" should be "spend."

---

### 4. **Task Achievement**: 7
- Answer all parts of the question: ✅
- Present relevant ideas: ✅
- Fully explain these ideas: ❌ (Some ideas are underdeveloped)
- Support ideas with relevant, specific examples: ❌

You address the task and offer reasons for both sides of the argument, which is good. However, some of your points need further development. For example, the Japanese example is interesting, but you do not explain clearly how it supports the argument for a shorter workweek. Similarly, the point about people who prefer to work longer hours for financial reasons could be expanded with more details or examples.

**Suggestions**:
- Expand on the Japanese example: "In countries like Japan, where overworking has led to a decline in birth rates and mental health issues, a shorter workweek could alleviate these problems."
- Provide a clearer example of the people who need to work overtime: "For example, single parents may prefer longer hours to secure a better future for their children."
