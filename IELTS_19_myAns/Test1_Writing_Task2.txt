Write at least 250 words.

============================================================================

My Answer :

As we are all living in a swift developing world, it seems like we have already normalized comparing and competing ourselves with others in every aspects. We cannot deny competition at workplace, schools, universities, and in our daily lives gave us advantages but we also should not ignore the disadvantages and profits of working together in harmony.

We already seen alot regarding competitive people in our environment. And we can witness that most of them are highly energetic and motivative than others. With competitive type of people,especially employees, manager and higher authories of the organization do not need to keep an eye on them for the sake of efficient work and such mindset create a person with firmmer responsibility. And they are type of workaholics and they will go an extra mile just for the sake of one step ahead than his co-worker. The logic is also the same in educational places like schools and universities. Such mindset encourage the students to study with more focus and willingness, not to humiliate themselves among the toppers in the class. Nonetheless, competition in daily life is not a suitable practice for anyone as it hold more negative consequences than it can do good, for instance, unnecessary competition in our daily lives will lead us to depression and self-underestimation.

A better approach for better productive environment of workspace and better educative environment of school and universities is cooperation. Cooperation is the actual ability what make us the most superior creature among other. There are animals with bigger brains, animals who can memorize things like us, solve puzzles, and so forth. But humans are here because of one ability, cooperation. Without it, we will still be hairless monkeys. Working together build civilizations, society, and evloutions. So competitions stand no change to competete the ultimate ability of humans, cooperation. Moreover, that ability encourage team-work while competitions support selfishness. Students are taught to work in pair than alone in schools today to fuel team-work and cooperation. Organizations and Operations are working in groups of people and they are depending on those groups not an individual. 

To conclude the two opinions, it is acceptable that competitions can profit us in numerous way but there is no way it is superior to cooperation and team-work. In fact, we should motivate ourselves by looking those successful person and work together to achieve what we desire.

However, there is room for improvement in linking phrases. For example, using a variety of connectors (such as "Moreover," "On the other hand," etc.) will increase the fluency of your response. Sentences like "Nonetheless, competition in daily life..." could use stronger transitions, and some arguments need further explanation.

### 2. **Lexical Resource**: **6.0**

- **?** Try to vary your vocabulary using accurate synonyms  
- **✔** Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning  
- **✘** Check your work for spelling and word formation mistakes  

Your vocabulary is sufficient, but there are some errors that affect clarity:
- "alot" should be "a lot."
