My Answer :

As we are living a rapidly developing world with highly competitive people, business bodies these days focus mainly on the advertisements that show their products are new in any possible way.

There are considerable amount of causes for the issue. Prior to all, people nowadays cannot satisfied easily, they want more and more sensations and stimulations in any possible way. It is because the evolutions in our world is immensely fast that people are experiencing new things from time to time, nurfing their brains to response small stimuli and desiring more and larger stimulations. 

Another factor for the cause is that demand is the vital driver in the business world. So with demand, they have nothing other than fulfilling what customers desired. As the Burmese proverb, "Even ultimate fulfilling angels of abundance cannot satisfy humans' will.", business organizations complementing the demands of customers and greedy customers demanding more endlessly,and that creates the never-ending circle, and forced the business to focus on new products or advertise the products not to look like old ones tricking the customers.

In this issue, negative consequences will outweigh the positive ones, i believe. For the good, such improvements will make business industries show more respect to customers' need and requirements. For instance, the Coca Cola company is manufacturing the same product for decades, but they respect their customers, appealing them with different bottles with always changing designs along with proper collaborations with other industries. On the other hand, people in business industries are forced to be more creative everyday, in which the approach is not completely right that creativity and stress never live in a same cave. Furthermore, by trying to fulfilling the people wishes, not only fulfiller but also wishers are becoming tired that genies cannot fulfil to satisfy the wishes while wishers are drowning in wishes and developing new ones each day as they are trained to.

To conclude the causes and consequences, advertising companies and business industries, trying to appeal customers with newer products or products that seems like one, actully do not deserve the blame as they are just trying to survive in their field and trying what suit them best. But we can control ourselves from demanding more, so that we are the one who can only break the circle.

GPT Assessment :

### Overall Band Score: 6.5

#### Coherence and Cohesion: 6.5
- **Structure your answers in logical paragraphs**: ✔  
- **One main idea per paragraph**: ✔  
- **Include an introduction and conclusion**: ✔  
- **Support main points with an explanation and then an example**: ✔  
- **Use cohesive linking words accurately and appropriately**: ?  
- **Vary your linking phrases using synonyms**: ✘  

The essay has a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, there are instances where cohesion could be improved. For example, the transition between the first and second body paragraphs is abrupt, and linking words such as "another factor" are used repetitively. More varied linking phrases (e.g., "In addition," "Moreover") would enhance cohesion.  

#### Lexical Resource: 6.0
- **Try to vary your vocabulary using accurate synonyms**: ✔  
- **Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning**: ?  
- **Check your work for spelling and word formation mistakes**: ✘  

The essay demonstrates a good range of vocabulary but has several issues with word choice and spelling. For instance, "nurfing" is not a correct word; "numbing" or "dulling" might be what was intended. Additionally, "fulfilling" should be used more cautiously, and "people's" should replace "people" in some instances. There are also awkward phrasings like "business bodies" instead of "companies" or "corporations."

#### Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0
- **Use a variety of complex and simple sentences**: ✔  
- **Check your writing for errors**: ✘  

You use a mix of complex and simple sentences, but some sentences are overly complicated or awkward. For example, "business organizations complementing the demands of customers and greedy customers demanding more endlessly" could be clearer. There are also issues with verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and article usage (e.g., "a rapidly developing world" instead of "a rapidly developing world," and "nurfing their brains to response" should be "numbing their brains to respond").

#### Task Achievement: 7.0
- **Answer all parts of the question**: ✔  
- **Present relevant ideas**: ✔  
- **Fully explain these ideas**: ✔  
- **Support ideas with relevant, specific examples**: ?  

The essay addresses both parts of the question, explaining why businesses emphasize new products and discussing the positive and negative impacts of this trend. However, some ideas could be more fully explained or better supported with examples. For instance, the mention of Coca-Cola is relevant but lacks depth in its explanation of how the company balances tradition and innovation. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points but could be more decisive in discussing whether this trend is mostly positive or negative.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Improve sentence clarity and grammar**: Simplify overly complex sentences and focus on ensuring subject-verb agreement, verb tense, and correct word forms.  
   - For example: "Business organizations try to meet customers' demands, but their efforts to appear innovative often create a cycle of never-ending consumer desire."
   
2. **Vary your linking phrases**: Use a wider range of cohesive devices to connect ideas smoothly.  
   - For instance, instead of repeating "another factor," you could use: "In addition," "Moreover," or "On the other hand."

3. **Expand on examples**: Support your points with more concrete, detailed examples.  
   - Example: "Coca-Cola frequently updates its packaging design while maintaining the same product, demonstrating that innovation doesn't always require a new product but can be achieved through other means."

4. **Use a variety of vocabulary and ensure accuracy**: Double-check your word choices to avoid awkward or incorrect terms.  
   - Example: Instead of "nurfing," use "dulling" or "numbing" for a more precise expression.
