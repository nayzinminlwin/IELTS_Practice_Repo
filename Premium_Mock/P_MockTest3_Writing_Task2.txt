My Answer : 

As we are living in a highly competitive world, youths nowadays are having significant pressure regarding the success in academic. The trend goes on and people are starting to believe non-academic subjects, like football, basketball, cookery should be withdrawn from school curriculum for the sake of better emphasize learning on academic subjects.

Especially, civilians in developing countries are economically poor, thus they innately interest more on possible incomes than their unexplored hobbies, and unknown interest of studies. For instance, most parents in Asian countries want their children to choose specifications/studies that can give them broader chance of employment with better income like Medical Studies, Law, Business, Computer Science, and so forth. In that point, we cannot complain their choices as they are not having many options to choose but to compete in the traditional rat race of employment markets. So, it is important for such students to invest all possible available time they have in studies, that may profit them in their future careers, than physical subjects and cookery classes.

On the other hand, by such concentrating approach, it seems like a wrong approach to practice as it is forcing the students to learn the subjects they possibly do not show interest nor love. By doing so, people these days are becoming more specialists than generalist like some of us even do not know the general basics such as how many states composed our own nation, leave alone the state names. Furthermore, substracting the non-academic subjects in schools may stress a lot of students in which they are at worry-free ages and they need physical exercises and fun for their growth. Without them it will degrade not only the physical health and general knowledge but also the mental health of the students. And with such approach, we do not know how many youth dreams have been slain by high expectations of greedy parents and wrong education systems.

To conclude the believes and argues, we are living in a varying world, we cannot justify every thing to our preferences. So we should adapt to our environmental needs and improve as much as we can when we grid chances, like teaching our children non-academic subjects as leisure activities in students' free time.
