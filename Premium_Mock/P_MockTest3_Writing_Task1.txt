GPT Assessment :

### Overall Band Score: 6.0

### 1. **Coherence and Cohesion: 6.0**
   - ✔ Structure your answers in logical paragraphs

   - ? Support main points with an explanation and then an example
   - ✔ Use cohesive linking words accurately and appropriately
   - ? Vary your linking phrases using synonyms

**Comments:**
The response is organized logically, with clear paragraphs describing the data for each region. However, more detailed comparisons and specific examples (such as mentioning more differences between the regions or linking gender and region more explicitly) would strengthen the response. Cohesive devices like "In contrast," "Moreover," and "Finally" are used correctly, but there's room to vary them more.

**Suggestions:**

### 2. **Lexical Resource: 6.0**
   - ✔ Try to vary your vocabulary using accurate synonyms
   - ? Use less common question-specific words that accurately convey meaning
   - ✔ Check your work for spelling and word formation mistakes

**Comments:**
The vocabulary used is generally appropriate, but there is repetition of certain words, such as "illiterate" and "people." Also, some phrases are awkward or unclear, such as "people in which illiterate men" and "in literature," which is not the most suitable phrasing. More precise vocabulary and varied synonyms could improve this score.

You have demonstrated a variety of sentence structures, but some grammatical errors affect clarity, such as "indicating almost 60% of the people in which illiterate men are near 35%" and "there are more illiterate men in Sub-Saharan Africa than Arab." These errors stem from awkward phrasing and incorrect use of prepositions or conjunctions.
