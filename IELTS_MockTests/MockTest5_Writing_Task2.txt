Sample answer by Examiner :

Urban migration is causing extreme pressure on housing and infrastructure and, consequently, some people feel that public parks have become a luxury that we can no longer afford. While it is true that green areas can take up a lot of space, the benefits to the residents of a city and to the environment are too numerous to ignore.

It is undeniable that parks provide valuable leisure amenities – a place to picnic, walk, kick a ball, play with the children, or just relax. Besides this, recent research has shown that they also provide appreciable health benefits by allowing people to engage with nature, which enhances their mental well-being and lowers their stress levels. Consider also that, with the rising epidemic of obesity, it is more important than ever to make space available for physical exercise. The bonus of exercising in a natural setting, rather than going to a gym or jogging on urban streets, is that not only does the body benefit from the physical activity but anxiety and depression are alleviated as well. It is reported that the overall effect of “green exercise” is better fitness, lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels and greater tranquillity. Moreover, for lower socio-economic groups, parks are an affordable way to
 improve health and participate in social interaction.

City planners should also consider environmental benefits before deciding to sacrifice parkland for construction. Trees improve air quality by removing pollutants and filtering the air. Furthermore, if parks are located alongside urban waterways, they help keep the water clean by absorbing contaminated runoff from the city’s hard surfaces.

In conclusion, although I appreciate the problem, I wholeheartedly disagree with the view that parks should be used to mitigate housing shortages in cities. They offer significant health and recreation benefits to the people and improve the overall climate and environment of the city. If space is truly at a premium, city officials would do better to look at reducing the urban sprawl of shopping malls and parking lots.

My Answer : 

In this fast evolving world, significant amount of urban cities are experiencing accomodation issues because of land shortage for new buildings. Local authorities consider solution may stand in demolishing of parks to assign the areas for housing.

As we are living in fast developing countries that we cannot deny the need of accomodations and buildings as the population volume is escalating year per year. It took almost centuries to double the birth count per second in previous eras, for instance the researchs said 2 people are born every one second during the year of 2010 which is not very differnt from previous decades, then it soared up to 4 people per second around 2020. 

Another fact is that the authorites and business community do not see the parks and those lands as beautiful nor applicable, instead they consider they can grind the economy of the country or their company by replacing those parks with interprise compounds and business headquarters.

One the other hand, we are missing the truth that we already have uncountable rural areas or lands that need to be developed and in which we can build accomodations, headquarters for the sake of ours and locals' needs and improvements. With such kind of implementation, those local will have better transportation, education, healthcare, career growth, which are actual factors that will unevitably draw an upward trend in Nation's economy. 

Without the land of parks and gardens in our cities, we are one step ahead to make our environment look like those disgusting urban cities in movies of cyber bots and AI robots. Moreover, there will also be a lot more carbon emission.

To sum up the opinions, why do we need to brainstorm unnecessary problems if we already have solutions ? So the idea of ruining the park lands for new buildings in the cities while we already have enourmous landmasses to build things seems like flopping a dead horse.

AI result: 

### IELTS Writing Task 2 Evaluation:

#### Task Response: Band 6
- **Strengths:** 
  - You express your position clearly and consistently (disagreeing with the proposal to reassign parkland for housing).
  - You provide some relevant ideas, such as population growth and the availability of rural land, as well as a counter-argument to park destruction.
  
- **Areas for Improvement:** 
  - The essay lacks a clear focus in certain sections, such as when you refer to cyber bots and AI robots, which seems irrelevant to the task.
  - Some arguments, such as authorities' perception of parks and the suggestion to develop rural lands, are not fully explained or supported with specific examples or clear connections to the housing crisis.
  - Ideas like carbon emissions are briefly mentioned without further explanation or evidence.
  - You could strengthen your argument by providing more detailed support and relevant examples for your ideas, such as specific examples of urban or rural planning success.

#### Coherence and Cohesion: Band 6
- **Strengths:**
  - Your essay has an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, creating a logical structure.
  - Basic linking words such as "Another fact," "One the other hand," and "To sum up" are used to connect ideas.
  
- **Areas for Improvement:** 
  - Cohesion between sentences is sometimes weak. For example, the second paragraph about birth rates does not clearly connect to the housing crisis issue. The paragraph shifts topics without sufficient transition.
  - The use of "instead they consider they can grind the economy" is unclear and disrupts cohesion. More natural linking devices and transitions between ideas would improve the flow of your argument.
  - Some ideas, such as carbon emissions and the transformation of rural areas, should be expanded to improve coherence.

#### Lexical Resource: Band 6
- **Strengths:**
  - You use a variety of vocabulary, such as "accommodation," "demolishing," "implementations," and "enterprise compounds," showing an attempt to use less common words.
  
- **Areas for Improvement:** 
  - Some words are used incorrectly or awkwardly, such as "accommodation issues" (better: "housing shortages"), "grind the economy" (unclear meaning), and "unevitably" (incorrect spelling and should be "inevitably").
  - You repeat certain words (like "accommodation") and expressions frequently, showing limited flexibility in paraphrasing.
  - There are some spelling mistakes like "accomodation," "enourmous," and "researchs," which impact your lexical precision.

#### Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6
- **Strengths:**
  - You attempt to use a mix of simple and complex sentences, which demonstrates a variety of structures.
  - You show some awareness of complex grammar, for example: "those local will have better transportation, education, healthcare, career growth."
  
- **Areas for Improvement:** 
  - Grammar mistakes are frequent and sometimes interfere with meaning. For example, "locals' needs and improvements" (awkward phrasing), "We already have uncountable rural areas" (incorrect word choice, should be "numerous rural areas"), and "fast evolving world" (better: "rapidly evolving world").
  - There are many errors in subject-verb agreement ("researchs said 2 people are born," should be "research says two people are born").
  - Sentence fragments and comma splices (such as "Without the land of parks and gardens in our cities, we are one step ahead to make our environment...") should be corrected for clarity.
