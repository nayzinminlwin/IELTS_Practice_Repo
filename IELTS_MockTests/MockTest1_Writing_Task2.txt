My Answer : 

In the competative world, people are having more tough periods days after day. The most common difficulty people facing these days are job disatisfaction as significant amount of people are working in fields that they hate or they have no talent of. The solution to this problem became an alarming issue for both employer and employee.

To effectively cope with a problem, we have to find the source of it. Why are we having job disatisfaction ? Why do people choose careers which they show no interest ? As far as I know, the major factor of this problem is current job markets, in which even professionals with talents are struggling to survive. And the works and jobs are always associated with business that there are chances that working on the thing you love cannot feed your family or sometimes even yourself. So, nowadays, most of the student are worrying in choosing specialization of the study in the University for making more money, not for pursuing what they love. And it is the traditional way of parenting kids in most of the developing country. In Myanmar, we even have a saying, "Hobby is not something that feed you.",in which we do not know how many dreams are slayed.

The first consquence regarding the issue is the low or no productivity in workspace that will degrade the employer business or organization and the employee mind and brain. Another consequence followed is the burn-outs. In information technology sector, burn-outs happen most occassinally as the pressure and guilt drain the developers very much. For instance, a developer may feel guilty if he considerd himself as non innovative and even if he do so, it is very stressing to implement ideas to real life. The last consequnce is the depression. After all those happenstances, the employer may fall into deep hole of depression and he may even give up to work anymore.

So we have discussed, the cause and consequenses of the hated works and no- talented works that we should encounter them in a wise way to improve our daily lives.

Sample Answer :

In many countries throughout the world, young people are pushed into careers that they have no aptitude for, or do not want to do, and there are two main reasons for this situation.

The first reason is lack of tertiary study options. In some countries, such as China, there are limited places available for tertiary study, and those who do not manage to earn a place at the institution of their choice often find themselves studying a subject which does not interest them, or which is a poor match for their skills and aptitudes. The other main reason, which is closely aligned to the former point, is parental aspirations. Many parents push their children into a limited set of career options because these choices represent social success, security and money in later life. In many cases, the skills and needs of the children are ignored, as their parents encourage them to earn places in prestigious, if inappropriate, institutions and to study subjects that are acceptable to their friends and extended family.

Some of those children who do manage to jump through all the required hoops find that they are trapped in a career which does not suit their needs or abilities, and that they can see no escape from the life sentence imposed by well-meaning family. This can have both personal and social consequences. Firstly, unsatisfied workers can suffer from job stress, which drains human potential and may lead to physical and psychological illness. Dissatisfaction and distress also impacts on their chosen profession and on society as a whole, as unhappy and disaffected workers tend not to give their best, and this affects the quality of their work.

In conclusion, a person who is pushed into uncongenial work because of social constraints or family pressure is not likely to be a productive and happy member of society. We need to ensure that individual talents and skills are recognised and catered for if we are to have a harmonious and well-developed society.
